# Binary Search Algorithm Example

This is a simple example demonstrating the usage of the recursive binary search algorithm implemented in the `BinarySearch` class from the `Trees` namespace.

## Code Explanation

The provided code performs a binary search on a sorted array of integers to find a specific target value.

- An array of integers named `array` is defined and initialized with a list of sorted integers.
- The `BinarySearch.Search` method is called with the array and the target value.
- If the target value is found, the program outputs "found!", otherwise it outputs "not found :C".

## Usage

To use the binary search algorithm provided by the `BinarySearch` class:

1. Make sure you have imported the `Trees` namespace.
2. Create a sorted array of integers.
3. Call the `BinarySearch.Search` method with the array and the target value.
4. Check the result and handle accordingly.

## Requirements

- C# compiler
- .NET framework
